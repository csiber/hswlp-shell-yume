# Usage Guide

This project is built with Nuxt 3 and Cloudflare Workers. All API endpoints are serverless and must be called via `fetch()`. JWT tokens are stored locally and not in cookies.

## Content Policy

To keep the community safe, explicit NSFW content is not allowed. The system uses automated checks to filter out inappropriate images and prompts. Users uploading or requesting prohibited content will receive an error.

- Do not upload sexual, violent or abusive material.
- Requests containing banned keywords will be rejected.
- NSFW images are automatically detected and blocked.

Please use the platform responsibly and respect other members.

## Terms Acceptance

When uploading files for the first time you must agree to the Terms of Service. The upload button will stay disabled until you check the acceptance box. Your choice is saved in your browser so you don't have to confirm every time.
